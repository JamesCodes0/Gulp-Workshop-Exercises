# Gulp Workshop Exercises

These are a bunch of exercises for the Gulp.js workshop. 

If you are coming to a workshop, before you come:

## Install Node + NPM

Head on over to <https://nodejs.org/en/> and download the latest version of **Node.js**. This will also come with **npm**. 

## Already have Node? Check versions!

Open a terminal and type `npm -v && node -v`. You should see the latest version of npm and node. You can check them again the versions on <https://nodejs.org>

## Install All the exercise Dependencies

1. Download all the exercises _or_ clone this repo somewhere safe (Not your Desktop!)
2. We need to make sure we have installed all the dependencies before the class. You can do this by running `npm run deps` from the main exercise folder. That will go through each exercise directory and do an `npm install` on each of the package.json files. **This will take a while if it's your first time doing it.**
