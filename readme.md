# Gulp Workshop Exercises

These are a bunch of exercises for the Gulp.js workshop. 

If you are coming to a workshop, before you come:

## Have a Terminal / Command Line Ready

We will be running gulp via the command line so a terminal is helpful to have. 

On OSX, you can go to `Applications` → `Utilities` → `Terminal`. If you know what you are doing here, you are welcome to use iTerm2 with Bash, ZSH or Fish.

On Windows, you may use the built in one at  `Start` → `Powershell` **however** I think you will much prefer to use the [cmder console emulator](http://cmder.net/).

## Install Node + NPM

Head on over to <https://nodejs.org/en/> and download the latest version of **Node.js**. This will also come with **npm**. 


## Already have Node? Check versions!

Open a terminal and type `npm -v && node -v`. You should see the latest version of npm and node. You can check them again the versions on <https://nodejs.org>

## Install All the exercise Dependencies

1. Download all the exercises _or_ clone this repo somewhere safe (Not your Desktop!)
2. We need to make sure we have installed all the dependencies before the class. You can do this by running `npm run deps` from the main exercise folder. That will go through each exercise directory and run a `npm install` for you on each of the package.json files. **This will take a while if it's your first time doing it.**
